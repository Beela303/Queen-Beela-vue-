# Queen Beela (vue)
This is my personal website (v2), the first version is a pure html website without using a javascript framework (it can be found at https://beela303.github.io/QueenBeela). 
<br>
I decided to make another one using the same design but this time with Vue. 
The libararies used in the v1 were also included in this.
<br>
There are only a little modifications compared to the original.
